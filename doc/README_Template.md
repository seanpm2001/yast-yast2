>   what it cannot do (unsupported scenarios), limitations
> * Links to the documentation, high level and low level descriptions

> * How to build the sources (make/rake commands…)
> * How to setup a testing environment (e.g. iSCSI target for iSCSI client)
> * How to run the code to test a change (esp. needed for non trivial

Development
===========

This module is developed as part of YaST. See the
[development documentation](http://yastgithubio.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development/).


Getting the Sources
===================

To get the source code, clone the GitHub repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/yast/<repository>.git

If you want to contribute into the project you can
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository and clone your fork.


Development Environment
=======================

> *If the module needs specific development setup then describe it here,
> otherwise remove this section.*


Testing Environment
===================

> *Here describe (or link the docu, man pages,...) how to setup a specific environment
> needed for running and testing the module.*

> *Example: for iSCSI client you might describe (or link) how to setup an iSCSI server
> so it could be used by the client module.*


Troubleshooting
===============

> *Here you can describe (or link) some usefull hints for common problems when <b>developing</b> the module.
> You should describe just tricky solutions which need some deep knowledge about the module or
> the system and it is difficult to figure it out.*

> *Example: If the module crashes after compiling and installing a new version remove `/var/cache/foo/`
> content and start it again.*
